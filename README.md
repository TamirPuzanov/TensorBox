# TensorBox  
An application for designing, training and prototyping neural network models with complex architecture. Using a graphical language to describe the structure and training cycle of models will speed up your work, improve the quality and productivity of your solutions. We want the process of developing deep learning models to be simple and take less time, and ready-made solutions surprise in quality.
